<h2><a name="einl">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The <tt>nntpmlib</tt> is a C-library, which implements parts of the
NNTP-protocol and the common NNTP-extensions. To not produce a big overhead
the functions are very close to the protocol: Most functions correspond to
exactly one command of the NNTP-protocol. Besides there are some auxiliary
functions for parsing the responses of the server and things like this.</p>

<h3><a name="nntp">The nntp-protocol</a></h3>

<p>The nntp-protocol is textual network-protocol based on TCP. NNTP-servers
usually listen on port 119. A complete list of NNTP-commands can be obtained
from the RFC977. The following command exist according to this RFC:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>article [MessageID|Number]</tt></li>
<li><tt>body [MessageID|Number]</tt></li>
<li><tt>group newsgroup</tt></li>
<li><tt>head [MessageID|Number]</tt></li>
<li><tt>help</tt></li>
<li><tt>ihave</tt></li>
<li><tt>last</tt></li>
<li><tt>list [active|newsgroups] [group_pattern]</tt></li>
<li><tt>newgroups yymmdd hhmmss [GMT] [&lt;distributions&gt;]</tt></li>
<li><tt>newnews newsgroups date time [GMT] [&lt;distribution&gt;]</tt></li>
<li><tt>next</tt></li>
<li><tt>post</tt></li>
<li><tt>quit</tt></li>
<li><tt>slave</tt></li>
<li><tt>stat [MessageID|Number]</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>This set of commands was insufficient in practice. So RFC2980 specifies so
called "common NNTP extensions". These are many other commands, which I can't
enumerate here. For example there is the <tt>XOVER</tt>-command for getting
article-lists in a more convenient way.</p>

<p>There are nearly no news-servers, which understand all those commands, and
even supported commands are frequently implemented incomplete or differing
from the RFC. (I.e. some options can not be used, and unusual response codes
are to be expected.) Furthermore some news servers understand some further
commands, which one can get with the <tt>help</tt>-command.</p>

<p>This library too implements only a very small part of all possible
commands. I wrote functions for those commands, which were most important for
me personally, and which are im my opinion the most frequently understood. Of
cause the selection ist totally arbitrary. In the section about <a
href="#implement">the implementation of own commands</a> one can learn about
how to extend the library.</p>

<p>To understand some of the following functions, it is necessary to know,
that a nntp-server manages pointers to an "actual group" and an "actual
article" for every connection from a client. When e.g. the
<tt>article</tt>-command is sent whithout further arguments, the server
sends the "actual article". The commands <tt>next</tt>, <tt>last</tt> and
<tt>group</tt> are used for changing these pointers.</p>

<p>In the moment the library doesn't manage those two pointers itself. So the
application has to do it itself - if necessary.</p>

<p>Furthermore one has to know, that each article in usenet has a unique
message-ID. In each group and on each server every article gets an
article-number. Whereas the message-ID ist globally valid, the number is only
valid in one group and for one server. In most cases the servers simply
numerate the articles recieved in increasing order. Older articles are
eventually removed.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="benutzung">Basics for using this library</a></h2>

<h3><a name="logging">Logging and error messages</a></h3>

<p>Many functions of this library take two function-pointers as
arguments:</p>

<pre>
   void (*log_func)(const char*),
   void (*error_func)(const char*),
</pre>

<p>If <tt>log_func</tt> is different from <tt>NULL</tt>, all status-messages
are passed to this function. If <tt>error_func</tt> is different from
<tt>NULL</tt>, error messages are passed to this function.</p>

<p>Those two function are only for output. Nearly all functions have return
values, which indicate whether an error occured or not. For all functions
returning an integer, a return value of 0 means (if not remarked otherwise),
that it was successful, another number, that there was an error.</p>

<p>If one wants to use error or log messages for things other than output,
one has to copy the strings, because the invoking functions free the memory
after calling <tt>log_func</tt> or <tt>error_func</tt>.</p>


<h3><a name="connect">Making and closing connections</a></h3>

<p>For this purpose there are the two functions</p>

<pre>
   nntp_server *nntpserver_connect (const char *servername, 
                                    unsigned short int port,
                                    void (*log_func)(const char*),
                                    void (*error_func)(const char*));
   void nntpserver_close (nntp_server *ns,
                          void (*log_func)(const char*),
                          void (*error_func)(const char*));
</pre>

<p>The type <tt>nntp_server</tt> is declared as follows:</p>

<pre>
   typedef struct {
     FILE *fin, *fout;
   } nntp_server;
</pre>

<p>These to elements are for reading from the socket and for writing onto the
socket.</p>

<p>The function <tt>nntp_connect</tt> tries to make a TCP-connection to the
server named in <tt>servername</tt> to the passed port. The servername may be
an IP-address or a name. In case of a success, the function returns a pointer
to a new variable of type <tt>nntp_server</tt>. Otherwise it returns NULL.</p>

<p>The function <tt>nntp_close</tt> closes the connection and frees the
memory allocated by the nntp_server*.</p>


<h3><a name="rueckgabe">Reading the answer of the server</a></h3>

<p>Some functions cause the server to send many lines of text. These lines
are not read by the functions itself, but have to be read by the
application. There are two functions, which help:</p>

<pre>
   char *get_line_from_server (nntp_server *ns, int *fin);
   char **get_lines_from_server (nntp_server *ns, int approx_lines, int *no_lines);
</pre>

<p>The first function reads one line of text from the server and returns it in
a new allocated string. The LF- and CR-chars, which terminate every line, are
then already removed. If there are no more lines, the function return
<tt>NULL</tt> and sets (if <tt>fin!=NULL</tt>) <tt>*fin=1</tt>. Otherwise
<tt>*fin=0</tt>.</p>

<p>If an error occured during reading, the function also return
<tt>NULL</tt>, but <tt>*fin</tt> stays 0. (So the integer <tt>*fin</tt>, if
existent, signifies a regular termination of the reading process, or a
reading error. In the latter case there is not much, what the application can
do.)</p>

<p>The second function reads all lines from the server and saves them in a
null-terminated array of newly allocated <tt>char*</tt>. In
<tt>approx_lines</tt> the expected number of lines should be given. Every
time the memory allocated is not sufficient, the function enlarges it at
50%. If <tt>approx_lines==0</tt> a default-value is taken. (So
<tt>approx_lines</tt> is only necessary for higher performance.) In
<tt>no_lines</tt> (if <tt>!=NULL</tt>) the number of lines read is
returned.</p>


<h2><a name="gr">Groups</a></h2>

<h3><a name="group_t">The data type for groups</a></h3>

<p>To hold a group -perhaps with supplementary information- in the memory,
there is the following data type:</p>

<pre>
   typedef struct {
     char *name;
     long int first, last;
     int flags;
   } group_t;
</pre>

<p><tt>name</tt> is the name of the group, <tt>first</tt> and <tt>last</tt>
the numbers of the first and the last article in this group on this
server. But it is not garanteed, that there is an article for every number
between these two. <tt>flags</tt> contains up to this moment only one
flag:</p>

<pre>
   #define POSTING_ALLOWED 1
</pre>

<p>For managing groups there are the following auxiliary functions:</p>

<pre>
   group_t *new_group_t ();
   void free_group_t (group_t *g);
   void printf_group_t (group_t *g);
</pre>

<p>The first function allocates memeory and initializes it with nulls. The
second function frees the allocated memory (including the
<tt>g-&gt;name</tt>).</p>

<p>The third function prints the information onto the standard output. It
only served debugging.</p>


<h3><a name="gruppen">Requesting group lists</a></h3>

<p>If connected to a server, one wants to know, which groups are
available:</p>

<pre>
   int nntp_list_groups (nntp_server *ns,
                         void (*log_func)(char*),
                         void (*error_func)(char*))
   int nntp_newgroups (nntp_server *ns,
	               const char *datetime_string, int gmt,
                       const char *distribution,
                       void (*log_func)(char*),
                       void (*error_func)(char*))
   group_t *parse_list_line (char *line)
</pre>

<p>The first function sends a <tt>LIST</tt>-command to the server. The server
should respond with a list of all its groups, every group in an own line and
with some supplementary information, which can be parsed with help of the
last of the three functions. The single lines have to be read by the
application itself, as has been mentioned above.</p>

<p>With the help of the function <tt>nntp_newgroups</tt> it is possible to
request all groups belonging to certain usenet hierarchies, which are newer
than <tt>datetime_string</tt>. But of cause only, if the command is correctly
implemented by the server. <tt>datetime_string</tt> must(!) have the format
"YYMMDD hhmmss" (without the quotes). It is supposed, that the time of the
server is used, except when <tt>gmt!=0</tt>. In this case it is supposed,
that the time is GMT.</p>

<p>The optional Argument <tt>distribution</tt> may also be <tt>NULL</tt>. If
not, it should contain a string as e.g. "<tt>&lt;alt.fan,de,comp&gt;</tt>"
(without quotes): a comma-seperated and bracketed list of hierarchies, in
which groups shall be searched. (In our case <tt>de</tt>, <tt>comp</tt> and
<tt>alt.fan</tt>-groups are searched.)</p>

<p>The last function takes a line as returned by the server after one of the
two functions above, parses it, and writes the result into a newly allocated
variable of type <tt>group_t*</tt>.</p>


<h3><a name="grset">Setting the actual group</a></h3>

<p>The actual group can be set with the function</p>

<pre>
   int nntp_group (nntp_server *ns, const char *group,
                   int *n, int *f, int *l,
                   void (*log_func)(char*),
                   void (*error_func)(char*));
</pre>

<p>In the variables <tt>*n</tt>, <tt>*f</tt> und <tt>*l</tt> the approximate
number of articles, the number of the first article and the number of the
last article is returned. If those informations are not needed, <tt>NULL</tt>
can be passed to the function.</p>


<h2><a name="art">Articles</a></h2>

<h3><a name="at">The data type for articles</a></h3>

<p>To manage the most important informations of an article, there is the data
type <tt>article_t</tt>:</p>

<pre>
   typedef struct {
     char *subject;
     char *from;
     char *id;
     char *newsgroups;
     char *date;
     char *references;
     char *fu2;
     char *reply_to;
     int lines;
     long no;
     long bytes;
   } article_t;
</pre>

<p>Important are in particular the message-ID <tt>id</tt>, which always is
bracketed (with &lt;&gt;). (E.g. it can be of the form
<tt>&lt;983hj$it$bbmb@news.irgendwo.de&gt;</tt>.) And the article-number
<tt>no</tt>.</p>

<p>For allocating, removing and copying variables of this type there are the
functions</p>

<pre>
   article_t *new_article_t ();
   void free_article_t (article_t *a);
   article_t *copy_article_t (const article_t *a);
   void printf_article_t (article_t *a);
</pre>

<p><tt>new_article_t</tt> allocates memory for a new <tt>article_t</tt>, sets
all values to 0, and returns a pointer to it. <tt>free_article_t</tt> tries
to free all memory allocated by the <tt>char*</tt>, which are
<tt>!=NULL</tt>, and frees the memory allocated by the structure
itself. <tt>copy_article_t</tt> allocates memory for a new <tt>aticle_t</tt>
and copies the data. All string are also copied with <tt>strdup</tt>.</p>

<p><tt>printf_article_t</tt> prints all information for an article onto the
standard output. It served mainly for debugging.</p>

<p>For inserting information about an article into the structure there are
the functions</p>

<pre>
   int insert_value_into_article_t (article_t *a, 
                                    const char *name, const char *value);
   int parse_article_header_line (article_t *a, const char *line);
</pre>

<p>The first function is selfexplaining (I hope). E.g.</p>

<pre>
   insert_value_into_article_t (a, "from:", "myname@irgendwo.de");
</pre>

<p>In this case a copy of the second string is inserted at the right
place. The parameter <tt>name</tt> is case-insenstive, but the colon is
important.</p>

<p>The second function takes a line, as sent by the server to the client, and
tries to extract some information about the article and insert it into the
<tt>article_t</tt>.</p>

<p>Both functions return 0, if some information could be inserted, -1
otherwise. The latter case may e.g. occur, if the information contained in
<tt>name</tt> and <tt>value</tt> or in the header-line <tt>line</tt> is not
contained in the <tt>article_t</tt>-structure.</p>

<p>To change the <tt>article_t</tt>-type, it is sufficient to change the
declaration of the type and those functions. (This shouldn't be a problem.) I
choosed a rather small selection of information for reasons of
performance.</p>


<h3><a name="xover">Requesting article lists</a></h3>

<p>To get an overview over all articles in a group there are the
functions</p>

<pre>
   int nntp_xover (nntp_server *ns, int min_no, int max_no,
                   void (*log_func)(char*),
                   void (*error_func)(char*));
   article_t *parse_xover_line (char *line, const char **format);
</pre>

<p>The first function sends the <tt>XOVER</tt>-command to the server: Each
response lines of the server contains informations about one article. With
help of the parameters <tt>min_no</tt> and <tt>max_no</tt> an article-region
can be specified. In detail the numbers have the following meaning:</p>

<table align="center" border="1">
<tr><td><tt>min_no</tt></td><td><tt>max_no</tt></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>-1</td>    <td>-1</td><td>no region given</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><tt>min_no</tt>==<tt>max_no</tt>&gt;=0</td><td>only this
article</td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;=0</td><td>-1</td><td>all articles from <tt>min_no</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;=0</td><td>&gt;=0</td><td>from <tt>min_no</tt> to
<tt>max_no</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The function <tt>parse_xover_line</tt> takes a response line as delivered
after such a <tt>XOVER</tt>-command, parses it, and writes the result into a
newly allocated <tt>article_t</tt>. <tt>format</tt> is a null terminated
array of strings, giving the format of those lines. If <tt>NULL</tt> is
given, the following default is taken:</p>

<pre>
   "subject:", "from:", "date:", "message-id:", "references:", "bytes:", "lines:"
</pre>

<p>Servers may deliver more information. In this case the format has to be
requested with the (not implemented) command <tt>LIST OVERVIEW.FMT</tt></p>


<h3><a name="next">Next and previous article</a></h3>

<pre>
   int nntp_next (nntp_server *ns, int *n, char **a, int mode,
                  void (*log_func)(char*),
                  void (*error_func)(char*));
</pre>

<p>serves for setting the pointer "actual article" to the next or the
previous article, depending which of the two values</p>

<pre>
   SET_TO_NEXT
   SET_TO_LAST
</pre>

<p>the parameter <tt>mode</tt> has. In case of success in <tt>n</tt> (if
<tt>!=NULL</tt>) the number of the (new) actual article is returned, and in
<tt>a</tt> (if <tt>!=NULL</tt>) its article-id.</p>


<h3><a name="get">Requesting articles</a></h3>

<p>Now one of the most important function: The function, which requests
articles from the server.</p>

<pre>
   int nntp_get_article (nntp_server *ns, article_t *ar,
                         int by_mode, int get_what,
                         void (*log_func)(char*),
                         void (*error_func)(char*));
</pre>

<p>If the request was successful, the application has to read the article
itself - perhaps with the help of <tt>get_line_from_server</tt>.</p>

<p>The parameter <tt>by_mode</tt> has one the values</p>

<pre>
   BY_MESSAGEID
   BY_MESSAGENO
   BY_NONE
</pre>

<p>It specifies, whether the article with the article-id set in <tt>ar</tt>,
or the article with the article-number set in <tt>ar</tt>, or the actual
article should be requested. In the last case <tt>ar</tt> can be NULL. In any
case the paramter <tt>ar</tt> is not changed by the function.</p>

<p>The parameter <tt>get_what</tt> has one of the values</p>

<pre>
   GET_HEAD
   GET_BODY
   GET_ALL
   GET_STAT
</pre>

<p>and specifies, which part of the article should be requested: Only the
article header, only the article body (without header), both (in this case
seperated by a blank line), or nothing. This last case <tt>GET_STAT</tt> may
e.g. be used for testing, whether a certain article exists. As far as I know
the "actual article" is set one article forward, if
<tt>by_mode==BY_MESSAGENO</tt> is used.</p>



<h3><a name="parse">Parsing of article headers</a></h3>

<p>If an article header or a whole article was requested with the above
function <tt>get_article</tt>, the header lines can be read and parsed with
help of the function</p>

<pre>
   article_t *nntp_read_header_lines (nntp_server *ns);
</pre>

<p>The result is returned in a new <tt>article_t</tt>. Because of the
article-header not containing the article-number (this is of cause not
possible, beacause the number is server-specific), the result cannot contain
it. If the number is needed it is to be set manually.</p>

<p>Not all elements of the <tt>article_t</tt> structure are obligatory for
the article header. So it is always possible, that some of the
<tt>char*</tt>-elements have NULL-values.</p>

<p>The function reads the response lines of the server, parses them, und
throws them away. In the case, that the whole article was requested, the
function stops reading when reaching the blank line. The article body then
has to be read by the application. In the case that only the article header
was requested, the function reads the whole response.</p>


<h3><a name="post">Posting of articles</a></h3>

<pre>
   int nntp_post (nntp_server *ns, const char **text,
                  void (*log_func)(char*),
                  void (*error_func)(char*));
</pre>

<p>With the help of this function a new article can be posted to the
server. <tt>text</tt> has to contain a NULL-terminated array of the lines to
post. (Every <tt>test[i]</tt> has to conatin one line or not.) But the
appliation has to ensure for itself, that the text if well formated according
to RFC0850. In particula this means:</p>

<ul>
<li>no special characters</li>
<li>Every line ends with a <tt>&lt;CR_LF&gt;&lt;CR_LF&gt;</tt>
(i.e. <tt>"\r\n"</tt>).</li>
<li>The article starts with a header, which is seperated by a blank line from
the rest of the article. (More modern servers only need a <tt>From</tt>,
<tt>Subject</tt> and <tt>Newsgroups</tt> and are able to fill in the
rest.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The terminating line, which consists only of a point, is sent by the
function itself. If the posting was successful, 0 is returned. -1 means, that
the article couldn't be sent. Probably the server forbids this. -2 means,
that sending was tried, but the server rejected the article - probably
beacause of an formatting error.</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="sonstige">Other commands</a></h2>

<h3><a name="help">Requesting the commands of a server</a></h3>

<p>A list of all commands understood by the server can be requested with the
function</p>

<pre>
   int nntp_help (nntp_server *ns, 
                  void (*log_func)(char*), void (*error_func)(char*));
</pre>

<p>The server will answer with a list of its commands including their
syntax. Every command in one line. Those lines have to be read and
interpreted by the application itself. (E.g. with help of
<tt>get_line_from_server</tt>.)</p>



<h3><a name="readermode">Setting reader- or slave-mode</a></h3>

<p>Some news servers behave differently depending on the client being a
news-reader or another news-server. For example other news-servers may get a
higher priority, because they serve several persons. Or for a news-reader
quicker algorithms for searching single articles may be used.</p>

<p>It is possible to inform the server whether the client is a news-reader
or a news-server:</p>

<pre>
   int nntp_set_mode_reader (nntp_server *ns, int mode, int *posting_allowed,
	                     void (*log_func)(char*), void (*error_func)(char*));
</pre>

<p>The variable <tt>mode</tt> must have one of the two values
<tt>NNTP_MODE_READER</tt> (we are a news-reader) or <tt>NNTP_MODE_SLAVE</tt>
(we are a news-server).</p>

<p>In the case <tt>mode==NNTP_MODE_READER</tt> the variable
<tt>posting_allowed</tt> will be set to 0 or 1 (if it is
<tt>!=NULL</tt>).</p>

<p>This command should not have any influence on whether the other commands
work or not. In large groups it may accelerate the work. If a server gives an
error message, because it doesn't understand this command, it is of cause
simply obsolete.</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="implement">Implementation of own commands</a></h2>

<p>For writing to and reading from the socket there are two variables of
type <tt>FILE*</tt>. So the implementation of own commands is very simple:
Write the command with <rr>fprintf</rr> onto the socket (don't forget the
<tt>fflush</tt> afterwards!), and then read the response with <tt>fgets</tt>
or something like this. The following functions may help a bit:</p>

<h3><a name="senden">Sending commands</a></h3>

<p>The following function is very practical:</p>

<pre>
   int nntp_send_command (nntp_server *ns, char *command,
                          char **response, int *rcode,
                          int *ok_codes, int *err_codes,
                          void (*log_func)(char*),
                          void (*error_func)(char*));
</pre>

<p>It sends the command <tt>command</tt> to the server. This string contains
the NNTP-commnd including all options or parameters. It must not end with
<tt>\r\n</tt>, which is added by the function.</p>

<p>The server will now send a response line, beginning with a numerical
response code. If <tt>response!=NULL</tt>, then <tt>*response</tt> will
(newly allocated) contain this line. If <tt>rcode!=NULL</tt>, then
<tt>*rcode</tt> will contain the numerical response code.</p>

<p><tt>ok_codes</tt> is a null terminated array containing those
response-codes, which signify a success. <tt>err_codes</tt> is a null
terminated array of response-codes, which can be sent by the server in case
of an failure. The general response 400 and &gt;=500  should not be contained
in it, because they are tested indepentently. In the case, that the response
code is not in <tt>ok_codes</tt>, the <tt>error_func</tt> (if
<tt>!=NULL</tt>) is called. If the response is neither a general response,
nor in <tt>ok_codes</tt>, nor in <tt>err_codes</tt>, an additional line
"illegal response from server" is given to <tt>error_func</tt>.</p>

<p>For some commands further text follows the response line. This text has to
be read by the application.</p>

<p>Here a simple example: A possible implementation of the
<tt>NEXT</tt>-command:</p>

<pre>
  int  ok_codes[]={223, 0};
  int err_codes[]={412, 420, 421, 422, 0};
  int err;
  char *response;

  err = 
    nntp_send_command ("next", &response, NULL, ok_codes, err_codes, NULL, NULL);
</pre>

<p>For reasons of conciseness there is no error processing and no parsing of
the response line in this example.</p>


<h3><a name="antwort">Reading the servers response</a></h3>

<p>Normally the function <tt>nntp_send_command</tt> reads the servers
response. If it is necessary to this manually, e.g. because the server sends
two response lines, as it is the case for the <tt>POST</tt>-command, the
following function helps:</p>

<pre>
  int read_server_response (nntp_server *ns, char **response, int *rcode,
                            int *ok_codes, int *err_codes,
                            void (*log_func)(char*),
                            void (*error_func)(char*));
</pre>

<p>The meaning of the parameters is exactly like for
<tt>nntp_send_command</tt>. Indeed the latter simply uses this function.</p>
