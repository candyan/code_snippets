<h2><a name="einf">Introduction</a></h2>

<p><tt>ploglib.c</tt> is a library, which is able to parse log-files of
HTTP-servers. This is done with the help of regular expressions, so the user
should be know something about those, if he wants to use the library.</p>

<p>The first thing necessary to parse a log-file, is to inform the library
about the used log-format. This is done via a modified regular
expression. This modified expression then is changed into a form usable for
C, and the parsing can be started. The parser return variables of type <tt><a
href="#access_t">access_t</a></tt>, in which all desired data is broken
down.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="logformat">Log-formats</a></h2>

<h3><a name="logformat_t">The log-format-type</a></h3>

<p>Log-formats are represented in the library by the type</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   logformat_t
</pre></tr></table>

<p>There are the following functions to construct and to free variables of
this type:</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   logformat_t *new_logformat (const char *formatstring);
   logformat_t *copy_logformat_t (logformat_t *lf);
   void free_logformat_t (logformat_t *lf);
</pre></tr></table>

<p>How the <tt>formatstring</tt> given as parameter for
<tt>new_logformat</tt> has to choosen, explains the next chapter.</p>

<p>The function</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   int access_t_equal (access_t *a1, access_t *a2)
</pre></tr></table>

<p>compares two variables of this type. It returns, if they are equal, -1,
otherwise 0.</p>


<h3><a name="formatstring">The format-string</a></h3>

<p>The <tt>formatstring</tt> given by the user is a regular expression, which
may however contain the following elements:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Abbr.</th><th>Name</th><th align="left">Meaning</th></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%S</td>
<td valign="top">requester</td>
<td>The IP-Address of the requesting client in the form x.x.x.x
(x=0...255).</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%C</td>
<td valign="top">command</td>
<td>The command given by the client. (e.g. GET or HEAD).</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%c</td>
<td valign="top">return code</td>
<td>The response code from the server (e.g. 200 for "ok" or 404 for "file not
found").</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%r</td>
<td valign="top">request</td>
<td>the file requested by the client.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%b</td>
<td valign="top">bytes</td>
<td>number of bytes delivered by the server.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%d</td>
<td valign="top">domain</td>
<td>the domain (or more precisely: the hostname given by the client), in which
the requested file is. This may be important, if the same server serves
several domains.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%f</td>
<td valign="top">referrer</td>
<td>If the client followed a link, the original file stands here.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%B</td>
<td valign="top">browser</td>
<td>The identification of the used browser.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%Y</td>
<td valign="top">year</td>
<td>4-digit year.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%M</td>
<td valign="top">month(numeric)</td>
<td>month, 1- or 2-digits.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%N</td>
<td valign="top">month</td>
<td>month, 3-letter abbreviation.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%D</td>
<td valign="top">day(numeric)</td>
<td>Tday 1- or 2-digits.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%E</td>
<td valign="top">day</td>
<td>day, 3-letter abbreviation.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%h</td>
<td valign="top">hour</td>
<td>hour, 1- or 2-digits.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%m</td>
<td valign="top">minute</td>
<td>minute, 1- or 2-digits.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">%s</td>
<td valign="top">second</td>
<td>second, 1- or 2-digits.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Here a somewhat constructed example. The lines in the log-file of the
server have the following form:</p>

<table bgcolor="#dddddd" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   61.103.208.80 - [18/Jun/2001:00:08:00] "GET /test/index.html HTTP/1.0" 200 989
</pre></tr></table>

<p>The string given to the function <tt>new_logformat</tt> to extract all
informations of the above line should have the following form:</p>

<table bgcolor="#dddddd" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   ^%S - \[%D/%N/%Y:%h:%m:%s\] "%C %r .+" %c %b$
</pre></tr></table>

<p>Internally the following things happen: The function replaces the strings
<tt>%S</tt>, <tt>%D</tt> and so on with regular expressions as <tt>(.*)</tt>
or <tt>(.[0-9])</tt>. It remembers, on which position in the string which
informations are, and saves all things in a varable of type
<tt>logformat_t</tt>. The user should not care about these things. The only
thing he should know, is, that the string given by himself must not contain
subexpressions in round parantheses (), which result in substrings in regular
expressions.</p>

<h3><a name="abbrev">Month and day abbreviations</a></h3>

<p>As can be seen in the table above, the library recognizes 3-letter
abbreviations for months and days. These are not the abbreviations of the
locale of the user, but the abbreviations of the local of the uid of the
server. In almost all cases it should be the C-locale, and the abbreviations
are the english standard-abbreviations. Those are set, when a new logformat
is constructed with <tt>new_logformat</tt>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the user has the possibility to change those abbreviations
manually for a log-format:</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   void change_month_abbrevs (logformat_t *lf, char **new_months);
   void change_days_abbrevs (logformat_t *lf, char **new_days);
</pre></tr></table>

<p>The second parameter is an array of 12 respectively 7 strings. The
abbreviations for the days start with 0 or sunday. The abbreviations for the
month with 0 for january. The given values are copied into newly allocated
memory. So the variables <tt>new_months</tt> and <tt>new_days</tt> may be
freed after the call.</p>

<p>A 3-letter abbreviation of a month or a day given, the corresponding
number can be found out with the function</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   int find_day3_abbrev (logformat_t *lf, char *day);
   int find_mon3_abbrev (logformat_t *lf, char *month);
</pre></tr></table>

<p>As above the day 0 is sunday. But now the january is the month 1, an
december the month 12.</p>


<h3><a name="dfname">The default-filename</a></h3>

<p>On most servers there is a default filename, in most cases
<tt>index.html</tt>, which is used, if the client requests a directory as
URL. There is the possibility to inform the library, that it has to add this
default-filename to request or referrer ending with a slash '/'. To do this,
two things are necessary:</p>

<p>First of all the default filename is to be set. This is done with the
function</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   void change_default_filename (logformat_t *lf, char *newdefault);
</pre></tr></table>

<p>If <tt>newdefault</tt> is NULL, no default filename is used.</p>

<p>The the flag <tt>LF_FLAG_EXPAND_DEFAULT_FILES</tt> is to be set. (Look in
the chapter about flags!)</p>

<p>Remark, that the default filename is not added, if the request of the
client doesn't end with a slash, because the library then has no possibility
to know, whether it is a directory or a file. But directory request in server
log files alway should end with a slash.</p>


<h3><a name="flags">Flags</a></h3>

<p>In the structure <tt>logformat_t</tt> there is an element called
<tt>flags</tt>, which is a bitwise combination of the following constants:
(in the moment there is just one)</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td valign="top">LF_FLAG_EXPAND_DEFAULT_FILES</td>
<td>If this flag ist set, and a default filename is set, the latter is added
to all requests and all referrers ending with slash '/' while
parsing.</td></tr>
</table>


<hr>
<h2><a name="accesses">Accesses</a></h2>

<h3><a name="access_t">The type access_t</a></h3>

<p>Before parsing a line, there has to be a type to save the result. Here it
is:</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   typedef struct {
      unsigned long int requester; /* IP-address of the requesting client */
                                   /* in networkbyte-order */
      char *command;               /* command (e.g. GET) */
      int rcode;                   /* return-code of the server(e.g. 200) */
      int bytes;                   /* number of delivered bytes */
      char *request;               /* what file was requested */
      char *domain;                /* what domain was requested */
      char *referrer;              /* from where the  surver came */
      char *browser;               /* which program he used */

      /* date and time in numbers */
      int dateY, dateM, dateD, timeH, timeM, timeS;
   } access_t;
</pre></tr></table>

<p>The single entries correspond to the abbreviations in the table in the
chapter about the <a href="#formatstring">format-string</a>. But the IP-address
of the client ist a numerical in networkbyte-order an not a string. And the
date and time-entries are numbers too.</p>


<h3><a name="speicher">Memory management</a></h3>

<p>To be able to work with <tt>access_t</tt>, some basic functions are
necessary:</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   access_t *new_empty_access_t ();
   void free_access_t (access_t *a);
   access_t *copy_access_t (access_t *a);
</pre></tr></table>

<p>This functions are selfexplaining - I think. The first function fills the
variable with empty values, i.e. <tt>NULL</tt>-pointers for
<tt>char*</tt>-entries, 0 for  requester, and -1 for all other numerical
values.</p>


<h3><a name="io">IO</a></h3>

<p>There are only two poor auxiliary functions:</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   void fprint_access_t (FILE *f, access_t *a);
   access_t *fscan_access_t (FILE *f);
</pre></tr></table>

<p>The first function prints the contents of the variable <tt>a</tt> without
any further information or explanation, but exactly in the form, which can be
read by the second function.</p>

<p>Those functions are for testing and debugging and are to be taken with
caution.</p>


<h3><a name="adddfname">Adding a default filename</a></h3>

<p>If the flag <tt>LF_FLAG_EXPAND_DEFAULT_FILES</tt> is set in a log-format,
the default filename is added to all requests and referrers ending with a
slash '/' while parsing, as it was explained above. The may also be done
manually:</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   void add_default_files (access_t *a, logformat_t *lf);
</pre></tr></table>

<p>This functions adds the default filename of the logformat <tt>lf</tt> (if
existent) to the request and the referrer of <tt>a</tt>, if ending with a
slash. This happens independently of the flag be set or not.</p>


<h3><a name="parse">Parsing of log lines</a></h3>

<p>This central function of the library looks as follows:</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   access_t *parse_log_line (char *line, logformat_t *lf);
</pre></tr></table>

<p>It tries to parse the line <tt>line</tt> with help of the logformat
<tt>lf</tt>. If successful, it returns the result in a newly allocated
<tt>access_t*</tt>. In case of an error <tt>NULL</tt> is returned.</p>

<p>Of cause even in the case of a success it is possible of even probable,
that not all elements of the <tt>access_t*</tt> returned are filled. In this
case they still have the "empty" values set by <a href="#speicher">
<tt>new_empty_access_t</tt></a>.</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="implementation">Notes about own implementations</a></h2>

<h3><a name="access_tt">Changes of the access_t</a></h3>

<p>To make changes in this data type is very easy: The type definition can be
change the the following functions have to be adapted:</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   access_t *new_empty_access_t ();
   void free_access_t (access_t *a);
   access_t *copy_access_t (access_t *a);
   int access_t_equal (access_t *a1, access_t *a2);
   void fprint_access_t (FILE *f, access_t *a);
   access_t *fscan_access_t (FILE *f);
   void add_default_files (access_t *a, logformat_t *lf);
</pre></tr></table>

<p>The last of these functions has probably to be changed only in very rare
cases.</p>


<h3><a name="logformat_tt">Adding and removing of parsed information</a></h3>

<p>If the access_t was changed, e.g. a new element was added, or an element
was removed, normally it is desirable to be able to extract this added
information of logfiles. This can be done as follows: In the file
<tt>ploglib.c</tt> there is a global variable called <tt>subterm</tt>, which
in the moment is defined as follows:</p>


<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   tt_type_t subterm[] = {
     {'S', "([0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3})"},  /* numerical IP of the client */
     {'C', "([a-zA-Z]+)"}, /* command of the clinet */
     {'c', "([0-9]+)"},    /* response code of server */
     {'r', "(.*)"},        /* requested file */
     {'b', "([0-9\\-]+)"}, /* number of delivered bytes */
     {'d', "(.*)"},        /* requested domain */
     {'f', "(.*)"},        /* referrer */
     {'B', "(.*)"},        /* browser */

     {'Y', "([0-9]{4})"},    /* 4-digit year */
     {'M', "([0-9]{1,2})"},  /* month, 1- or 2-digits */
     {'N', "([a-zA-Z]{3})"}, /* month, 3-letter abbrev. */
     {'D', "([0-9]{1,2})"},  /* day, 1- or 2-digits */
     {'E', "([a-zA-Z]{3})"}, /* day, 3-letter abbrev. */
     {'h', "([0-9]{1,2})"},  /* hour, 1- or 2-digits */
     {'m', "([0-9]{1,2})"},  /* minute, 1- or 2-digits */
     {'s', "([0-9]{1,2})"},  /* second, 1- or 2-digits */
     {'\0', NULL}
   };
</pre></tr></table>

<p>The type <tt>tt_type_t</tt> only contains a char and a string. The
variable <tt>subterm</tt> is a null-terminated array of this type. The letter
are those letter, which have to be used in the <a href="#formatstring">
format-string</a>. These are replaced by the corresponding regular
expressions, the strings in the variable <tt>subterm</tt>, when log-format is
constructed with the function <tt>new_logformat</tt>. Those regular
expressions have to be close in parantheses, because when parsing the
substring has to be taken out. In the definition above it is possible to see,
that %S is replaced by a regular expression, which matches strings of the
form x.x.x.x, where x contains 1-3 digits. To parse further information,
first of all, this variable <tt>subterm</tt> is to be adapted.</p>

<p>After this the parser itself -the function <tt>parse_log_line</tt>-, which
makes the connection between the types <tt>logformat_t</tt> and
<tt>access_t</tt>, is to be modified. In this function there is a big
switch-command, which writes the correct information into an empty
<tt>access_t</tt>. In the moment it start as follows:</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
    switch (subterm[lf-&gt;series[i-1]].letter) {
    case 'S': /* IP of the client */
      res-&gt;requester=inet_addr(tmpstr);
      free (tmpstr);
      break;
    case 'C': /* command */
      res-&gt;command=tmpstr;
      break;
    case 'c': /* response code */
      res-&gt;rcode = atoi(tmpstr);
      free (tmpstr);
      break;
    case 'r': /* requested file */
      res-&gt;request = tmpstr;
      break;
</pre></tr></table>

<p>In the local variable <tt>tmpstr</tt> the substring of the logline,
which has some information, is contained. This substring is newly
allocated. If the string itself it not needed, e.g. because only an integer
number is made of it as in the example above, it should be freed
afterwards. The Variable <tt>res</tt> (for result) contains the
<tt>access_t</tt>, which will be returned and which should contain the parsed
information.</p>

<p>To parse more or less information, this switch command has to be
adapted.</p>


<h3><a name="interna">Interna of the logformat-type</a></h3>

<p>If one wants to make something more in all those functions, it may be
necessary to change the type <tt>logformat_t</tt>:</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffbb" width="70%"><tr><td><pre>
   typedef struct {
     char *user_format;        /* the string as given by the user */
     regex_t pre_rex;          /* compiled regular expression */
     int *series;              /* nullterminated arraygiving the meanings of
                                  the single substrings of the regular   
                                  expression. Corresponds to the number of the
                                  variable subterm[] */
     size_t nmatch_size;       /* number of substrings in the regular 
                                  expression */
     char mon3[12][4];         /* 3-letter abbrev. for month. 0=january */
     char day3[ 7][4];         /* 3-letter abbrev. for day. 0=sunday */

     int flags;
     char *default_filename; 
   } logformat_t;
</pre></tr></table>

<p><tt>user_format</tt> contains the string as given by the user for the
function <tt>new_logformat</tt>, without any modifications. This function
then makes the replacement given by the global variable <tt>subterm</tt>,
compiles the regular expression produced this was, saves the compiles
expression into the element <tt>pre_rex</tt> (for "precompiled regular
expression").</p>

<p>Then the number of subexpressions in the regular expression to take has to
be saved (this is the number <tt>nmatch_size</tt>), and what meaning they
have. This is done by the element <tt>series</tt>: The first subexpression
(here represented by <tt>series[0]</tt> corresponds to the information
<tt>subterm[series[0]]</tt>. So if in the example above
<tt>series[4]==1</tt>, then the fifth subexpression of the regular expression
would contain the command of the client, because <tt>subterm[1]</tt> stands
exactly for this.</p>

<p>The elments <tt>mon3</tt> and <tt>day3</tt> contain the 3-letter
abbreviations of months and days. The elemente <tt>default_filename</tt> and
<tt>flags</tt> are selfexplaining, I think.</p>
